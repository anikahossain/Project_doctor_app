user stories: 
As a user, I wanted an app where I could search for doctors based on city, state and by specialty and be able to save them in my user's profile with their name, address, and phone number in order to reference their contact info and location when I needed their services

*MVP*
-The user is able to login or create an account and then is able to search for docotors, but at this stage they are only to search doctors by city and state. They are able to save the desired doctor to their user dashboard which displays the doctors name and street address

-Was not able to delete a user's account
-Was not able to update the user's preferences
